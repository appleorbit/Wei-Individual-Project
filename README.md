<h> Dataset <h>
The dataset used in this project is called “Tesla Global Deliveries 
and Production Dataset,” which comes from the Kaggle platform.
It’s a public synthetic dataset created for teaching and 
demonstration purposes, so it does not represent Tesla’s official 
delivery data. Still, the dataset is well-structured and includes 
realistic variables that make it a good simulation of real-world 
business scenarios.
